List of wierd stuff I've found.

techcenter website: "linux" link is to the windows doc
LCC WSIG 1.2 PDF:  section 17.3, page 191 says "TARGET: Obtained from the InstanceID field", but it is actually the FQDD.

MOFs:
  iDRACCardService:  Description was cut/paste from NIC description and forgot to change NIC->iDRAC
  iDRACCardAttribute: "To be determined in 12G implementation" -- doesnt seem appropriate for public mof

MOF and class WTF:
 -- gratuitous difference between SetAttributes and ApplyAttributes between NIC/RAID/BIOS and iDRAC.
 -- SetAttributes and ApplyAttributes have gratuitously different return values
