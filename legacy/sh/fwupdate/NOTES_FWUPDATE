REQUIREMENTS:
=============
The following programs are needed.
Python 2.7
XML-PARSER
XML-Twig
The desired image to be flashed must be an executable image for Windows

FEATURES:
=========
* Issue WSMan Identify
* Get list of Jobs
* Schedule a Job for now or at a specified time
* Delete all Jobs
* List software inventory
* Perform firmware update from URI or existing element
* Get system time
* Request a reboot

COMPATIBILITY:
==============
For iDRAC 1.2 (monolithic) and 2.2 (modular) versions and earlier:
The "Software Update" profile supports only the inventory. Hence the
job, reboot and update scripts will not work.




SCRIPTS INTRO:
==============
There are three different type of scripts.  The setup scripts (1st type)
are scripts that setup the environment for the system the scripts will 
run under to the idrac.  The information scripts (2nd type) monitor the
job status and obtain information of wsman such as the wsman inventory.
The running scripts (3rd type) are the scripts that run a desired process
of the user such as flashing the Bios, iDRAC or other software components.
  

A) InstanceID
   The InstanceID can be found by executing ./ws-inventory.sh.  Each numbered
   section has properties about a held image and the currently installed image
   version.  One of the properties is named instanceid.  The value assigned to 
   the instanceid is the argument needed for the ./ws-updateid.sh and 
   ws-updateid.sh.   

   The process to find the InstanceID for the script ./ws-update.sh is the same
   as the script ./ws-updateid.sh.
   
B) SourceURI
   The SourceURI consists of the method of transfer, the ip address that holds
   the image, and the image's name. 

   Example SourceURI:
       tftp://192.168.0.100/BIOS-2011.exe
       nfs://192.168.0.100/BIOS-2011.exe;mountpoint=/pub
       cifs://DOMAIN\\\\USER:PASS@192.168.0.100/pub/BIOS-2011.exe;mountpoint=E
       http://192.168.0.100/BIOS-2011.exe
       ftp://192.168.0.100/BIOS-2011.exe

   
C) RUNNING SCRIPTS:
The scripts contained in this directory can flash any item outputted by 
the execution of ./ws-inventory.sh. You can either do a rollback, restoring the 
previously flashed image onto the system, or update to a different image 
held via tftp, nfs, cifs, http, or ftp.  

    STEPS to flash an image:
    Details are in the introduction of Running Scripts. 
    1) ./ws-inventory.sh 
        The ws-inventory outputs the images and the images properties held
        within the idrac.  You will need the instanceID found here for the
        next script.  
    2) ./ws-updateid.sh InstanceID or ./ws-update.sh InstanceID SourceURI

       ./ws-updateid.sh is used to create a job to do a rollback, internally 
       updating the image to a previous image flashed on the idrac.
   
       ./ws-update.sh InstanceID SourceURI is used to create a job to update 
       the image externally by an outside source.
   
       The JID, Job ID number,  is outputed by the ws-updateid.sh and
       update.sh. It is the value assigned to the InstanceID.  The JID will
       be used to run this job in the next step. 

    3) ./ws-jobnow.sh JID
       The ws-jobnow.sh runs the job created in the previous step. 

    4) ./ws-rebootnow.sh
       A job is created to reboot the system.  The JID is collected for the
       next step.

    5) ./ws-jobnow.sh JID
       The job using the JID obtained from ws-rebootnow.sh is executed.

    6) ./ws-jobgetall.sh
       The most recently installed image will be displayed on the top.

D) Toubleshooting
If any problems occur the following scripts can be used.
 
   1) ./ws-jobclear.sh
      All the jobs will be cleared.  Try once more to flash the image.
   2) ./ws-jobgetall.sh
      The status of the jobs can be viewed using the ws-jobgetall.sh script.
   3) If you schedule for a reboot and a reboot does not occur, please try
      logging off from your system.
