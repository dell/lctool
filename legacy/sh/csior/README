USE CASE FOR Collect System Inventory On Restart(CSIOR)


1) First Enumerate the class DCIM_LCEmnumeration, look for the Attribute name
   "Collect System Inventory on Restart" and the instance id for that Attribute.
   Run: ./ws-attributelist.sh lc

2) Set the Attribute value to the required one. Eg: "Enabled"
   The accepted values are listed in the PossibleValue field for the 
   enumerated attribute.
   The IsReadonly field should be "false"
   Run: ./ws-attributeset.sh lc "Collect System Inventory on Restart"="Enabled"

3) Once the attribute is set, the value goes to pending and it must be applied
   by creating a configuration job.
   Run: ./ws-configjob.sh
   This will return a Job id of the form (JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX)

4) Check the status of job by enumerating the DCIM_LifeCycleJob Job instance
   For an interactive update (The script will continue to run, until you 
   specify it to stop) on your job status you can:
   A) Run: ./ws-jobget.sh JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

      For just the current status:
   B) Run: ./ws-attributeget.sh DCIM_LifecycleJob JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

5) Check the Attribute again to see that the current value for the attribute is
   set to the the value given in step 2.
   Run: ./ws-attributelist.sh lc and look for the Attribute Name "Collect System
   Inventory on Restart" and check the Current Value.

6) Some Attributes may need a reboot in order for the values to be set. In that
   case a Reboot job has to be created aand scheduled.
   Run: ./ws-reboot.sh
   You will get a Reboot ID of the form RID_XXXXXXXXXXXX. You can then schedule
   the reboot
   Run: ./ws-jobnow.sh RID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

7) Once the reboot is completed, depending upon the attribute you can check the
   BIOS(F2) or system services (Ctrl E) to see if the value is set.
