A) USE CASE FOR Collect System Inventory On Restart(CSIOR)


   1) First Enumerate the class DCIM_LCEmnumeration, look for the Attribute 
      name "Collect System Inventory on Restart" and the instance id for that 
      Attribute.
      Run: ./ws-attributelist.sh lc

   2) Set the Attribute value to the required one. Eg: "Enabled"
      The accepted values are listed in the PossibleValue field for the 
      enumerated attribute.
      The IsReadonly field should be "false"
      Run: ./ws-attributeset.sh lc "Collect System Inventory on 
      Restart"="Enabled"

   3) Once the attribute is set, the value goes to pending and it must be 
      applied
      by creating a configuration job.
      Run: ./ws-configjob.sh
      This will return a Job id of the form (JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX)

   4) Check the status of job by enumerating the DCIM_LifeCycleJob Job instance
      For an interactive update (The script will continue to run, until you 
      specify it to stop) on your job status you can:
      A) Run: ./ws-jobget.sh JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

         For just the current status:
      B) Run: ./ws-attributeget.sh DCIM_LifecycleJob JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

   5) Check the Attribute again to see that the current value for the 
      attribute is
      set to the the value given in step 2.
      Run: ./ws-attributelist.sh lc and look for the Attribute Name "Collect 
      System Inventory on Restart" and check the Current Value.

   6) To trigger CSIOR collecting the inventory, the system must be rebooted.
      Run: ./ws-reboot.sh
      You will get a Reboot ID of the form RID_XXXXXXXXXXXX. You can then 
      schedule the reboot
      Run: ./ws-jobnow.sh RID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

   7) Once the reboot is completed, depending upon the attribute you can check
      the BIOS(F2) or system services (Ctrl E) to see if the value is set.

B) Toubleshooting
If any problems occur the following scripts can be used.

   1) ./ws-jobclear.sh
      All the jobs will be cleared.  Try once more to flash the image.
   2) ./ws-jobgetall.sh
      The status of the jobs can be viewed using the ws-jobgetall.sh script.
   3) If you schedule for a reboot and a reboot does not occur, please try
      logging off from your system.
