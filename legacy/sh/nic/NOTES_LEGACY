A) list nic inventories based on the Attribute Service.
   1) When typing ./ws-nicinvent.sh the scripts USAGE will be printed as such
      below.
      USAGE: ./ws-nicinvent.sh AttrService
      The attribute service AttrService may be one of the following:
         nstr    = List NIC String Inventory
         nint    = List NIC Integer Inventory
         nview   = List NIC View Inventory
         nenum   = List NIC Enumerations
         nall    = List NIC ALL Attributes (Enumeration, String, Integer)

B) USE CASE FOR SET LegacyBootProto

   The SetAttribute method is used to set or change the values of NIC attribute
   LegacyBootProto


   1) First Enumerate the class DCIM_NICEnumeration, look for the Attribute 
      name LegacyBootProto. Ex: Target: FQDD - NIC.Embedded.1-1
      Run: ./ws-attributelist.sh nic

   2) Set the attribute to the required value.
      The accepted values are listed in the PossibleValue field for the 
      enumerated attribute.  Possible Values are PXE, iSCSI, NONE
      The IsReadonly field should be "false"
      Choose a value which is different from the CurrentValue field
      Run: ./ws-attributeset.sh nic NIC.Embedded.1-1 LegacyBootProto=iSCSI
      The output will show whether Reboot is Required

   3) Once the attribute is set, the value goes to pending and it must be 
      applied by using the CreateTargetedConfigJob() method. This method 
      creates the job to apply the pending value and also has the option to 
      create and schedule a Reboot job.
      Run: ./ws-targetedjob.sh DCIM_NICService NIC.Embedded.1-1
      This will return a Job id of the form (JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX) and also run the
      Reboot Job

   4) Check the status of job by enumerating the DCIM_LifeCycleJob Job instance
         For an interactive update (The script will continue to run, until you
         specify it to stop) on your job status you can:
         A) Run: ./ws-jobget.sh JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

         For just the current status:
         B) Run: ./ws-attributeget.sh DCIM_LifecycleJob JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

   5) Once the system is rebooted, Check the Attribute again to see that the
      current value for the attribute is set to the the value given in step 2.
      LegacyBootProto=iSCSI
      Run: ./ws-attributelist.sh nic and look for the LegacyBootProto attribute
      and check the CurrentValue field. It should show "iSCSI" 
      or
      ./ws-attributeget.sh DCIM_NICEnumeration NIC.Embedded.1-1:LegacyBootProto

   6) Depending upon the attribute you can check the BIOS(F2) or system 
      services (Ctrl E) to confirm the changes. 

C) Troubleshooting:
   1) To clean everything and rerun desired process execute the following 
      scripts.
        a) clear all jobs.
           Run: ./ws-jobclearall.sh
        b) create a new environment session to run scripts.
           Run: . ./sourceme-cleanup
           Run: . ./sourceme-first
           More information of clearing the environment can be found in the
           NOTES_SETUP
