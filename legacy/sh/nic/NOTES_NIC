A) list nic inventories based on the Attribute Service.
   1) When typing ./ws-nicinvent.sh the scripts USAGE will be printed as such 
      below.
      USAGE: ./ws-nicinvent.sh AttrService
      The attribute service AttrService may be one of the following:
         nstr    = List NIC String Inventory
         nint    = List NIC Integer Inventory
         nview   = List NIC View Inventory
         nenum   = List NIC Enumerations
         nall    = List NIC ALL Attributes (Enumeration, String, Integer)


B) USE CASE FOR SET NIC LAN MODES

   The SetAttributes method is used to set or change the values of a group of 
   NIC attributes.

   This example shows setting couple of Attributes for NIC: FQDD  
   NIC.Embedded.2-1

   1) First Enumerate the class DCIM_NICEnumeration, look for the Attribute 
      names VLanMode, LnkSpeed for
      Target: FQDD - NIC.Embedded.2-1
      Run: ./ws-attributelist.sh nic

   2) Set the attribute (VLanMode, LnkSpeed) to the required values.
      The accepted values are listed in the PossibleValue field for the 
      enumerated x attribute.
      The IsReadonly field should be "false"
      Choose a value which is different from the CurrentValue field
      Run: ./ws-attributeset.sh nic NIC.Embedded.2-1 VLanMode=Enabled
            LnkSpeed="100Mbps Full"
      The output will show whether Reboot is Required

   3) Once the attributes are set, the values goes to pending and they must be 
      applied by using the CreateTargetedConfigJob() method. This method 
      creates the job  to apply the pending values and also has the option to 
      create and schedule a Reboot job. To confirm the pending value
      Run: ./ws-attributeget.sh DCIM_NICEnumeration NIC.Embedded.2-1:VLanMode
      To create & schedule the job
      Run: ./ws-targetedjob.sh DCIM_NICService NIC.Embedded.2-1
      This will return a Job id of the form (JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX) and also run the
      Reboot Job

   4) Check the status of job by enumerating the DCIM_LifeCycleJob Job instance
         For an interactive update (The script will continue to run, until you
         specify it to stop) on your job status you can:
         A) Run: ./ws-jobget.sh JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX
   
         For just the current status:
         B) Run: ./ws-attributeget.sh DCIM_LifecycleJob JID_XXXXXXXXXXXX

   5) Once the system is rebooted, Check the Attribute again to see that the
      current value for the attribute is set to the the values given in step 2.      VlanMode=Enabled LnkSpeed="100Mbps Full"
      Run: ./ws-attributelist.sh nic and look for the Attributes VLanMode and
      LnkSpeed and check the CurrentValue fields.
      They should show "Enabled" and "100Mbps Full" 

   6) Depending upon the attribute you can check the BIOS(F2) or system 
      services
      (Ctrl E) to check the same Attributes

C) Troubleshooting:
   1) To clean everything and rerun desired process execute the following 
      scripts.
        a) clear all jobs.
           Run: ./ws-jobclearall.sh
        b) create a new environment session to run scripts.
           Run: . ./sourceme-cleanup
           Run: . ./sourceme-first
           More information of clearing the environment can be found in the
           NOTES_SETUP
